# 21st Century Power Systems Dynamics

## Overview
The objective of this course is to learn some fundamentals as well as state of the art in modeling and control of low inertia systems
- This means going into "classic" textbooks on dynamics
- ...as well as getting some fundamentals on inverters under our belts
- ...and reading a select group of papers

## Format
We will balance lectures on fundamentals -- drawn from textbooks -- with paper presentations and discussion.  The key deliverables will be group work building simulation models that reproduce and extend papers from the literature.

## Materials
We will use two textbooks.  Both are available through the library but also on the bCourses page for this course. 
- Machowski, Bialek and Bumby, "Power System Dynamics: Stability and Control" (2008; 2nd ed). (MBB in the table below)
- Yazdani and Iravani, "Voltage-Sourced Converters in Power Systems: Modeling, Control, and Applications" (2010).  (YI in table below)
